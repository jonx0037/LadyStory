# Lady's Story
This is Lady's story. Her life, as best as her owner can tell it, online. Lady is an Olde English Bulldogge, currently is 10 years old (July 2023) and is living the best life she can live for a dog. There will be plenty of stories, images, and other fun stuff posted on this site whenever her owner gets around to it. If the content is bad it's because of Lady's owner, Jonathan, not Lady. Lady doesn't 'do' web development, that's not her thing; she leaves that to her owner, who is trying to get better at it. If you like what you see on the site, or have any questions for Lady, please email them using the form (hopefully it works) on the site. 

Thanks, 

Jonathan, Lady's owner
