# Lady's Story
This is Lady's story. Her life's story is now online, as best as her owner can tell it. Lady is an old English Bulldogge, currently ten years old (July 2023), and is living the best life she can live for a dog. Plenty of stories, images, and other fun stuff will be posted on this site whenever her owner gets around to it. If the content could be better, it's because of Lady's owner, Jonathan, not Lady. Lady doesn't 'do' web development; that's not her thing; she leaves that to her owner, who is trying to get better at it. If you like what you see on the site or have any questions for Lady, please email them using the form (hopefully, it works) on the site. 

Thanks, 

Jonathan, Lady's owner
