So, have you guys heard about Lady? Yeah, she's this old English Bulldogge who's living her best life. Her owner's got her whole life story online, but let's be real, Lady's not the one doing the web development. That's not her thing. She's just living her best doggy life and leaving the website stuff to Jonathan, who's apparently trying to get better at it. But hey, if you like what you see, shoot Lady an email using the hopefully-working form on the site. Who knows, maybe she'll even write you back.
