# Lady's Story
This is the story of Lady, my Olde English Buldogge. She's a good girl. When her owner, Jonathan, gets around to it, there will be plenty of stories and photos and even videos posted on the site for people to enjoy. Lady would do it herself, but she doesn't 'do' web development; she leaves that to her owner, who's trying to get better at it, sorry. If you like what you see, or have questions for Lady, feel free to use the contact form, that I hope works, on the site, or email me at jonx03@pm.me. 

Thanks, 

Jonathan (Lady's Owner)
